# Architecture diagram rules

Each demo's `architecture.html` is a standalone, self-contained page served on its
own port and surfaced as an **Architecture** tab in Instruqt. These are the rules
they follow. Keep them consistent — learners move between demos.

## Structure

- **One fixed coordinate space** (`CANVAS_W` × `CANVAS_H`), absolute node positions,
  SVG edges computed from those coordinates. Never reflow for narrow screens.
- **Scale to fit instead.** `transform: scale()` on the canvas, sized to the pane,
  with `Fit` / `+` / `−` controls. Fit-to-width is the default and follows resizes.
  This is what keeps the diagram usable in Instruqt's split pane.
- **Detail panel stacks below the canvas** until the viewport is genuinely wide
  (≥1560px). Side-by-side starves the diagram.
- Containers, outermost in: **worker process** (dashed outline) → **task queue**
  (colored band) → **nodes**.

## Nodes read as source

Each box shows the real declaration — decorator line plus `class`/`def` signature:

```
@workflow.defn                  @activity.defn
class AgentWorkflow:            async def get_ip_address() -> str:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, question: str) -> str:
```

- **Author the line breaks in the node data** and render `white-space: pre`. Never
  let a box reflow on its own — it will wrap differently at a different zoom.
- Elide long parameter lists (`(self, ctx, request)`) rather than widening a box
  past its column. Width is expensive; see the trade-off below.
- Boxes that aren't declarations — external services, generated activities — keep
  the kicker + name + subtitle form.

## Color has one meaning per channel

Three independent channels. Don't let them borrow each other's hues.

| channel | encodes | how |
|---|---|---|
| **edge color** | call category (child workflow, Nexus, agent tool, setup, external) | line color + the legend |
| **file dot** | which source file the box lives in | small dot on the footer row |
| **syntax color** | Python tokens | text inside the code block |

- `--accent` means **one** thing: the agent tool-call category, plus selection
  affordances (active ring, focus outline). It is not for lane bands, headings, or
  code. Task-queue bands use `--lane-tq` (slate).
- **Syntax palette** is VS Code Light+/Dark+, independent of the diagram hues:
  `--syn-kw` keywords, `--syn-deco` decorators, `--syn-str` strings, bold ink for
  the declared name.
- **At most three files carry a hue** — that's the cap for colorblind separation
  across all pairs. Colored slots go to the files the demo is *about*; everything
  else is neutral. The filename text is always visible, so identity never depends
  on color.
- **Filenames are muted ink with a colored dot beside them**, never colored text.
- Every text color clears 4.5:1 on the node surface, in both themes.

Validate any categorical palette before shipping it — the `dataviz` skill has a
runnable checker. Don't eyeball colorblind separation.

## Interaction

- **Click a node** → ring it, dim the rest, keep its edges hot, fill the detail panel.
- **Click a file chip** → ring that file's nodes, dim the rest, keep only edges that
  *touch* it, so a cross-file call reads as an edge leaving the lit set. The panel
  lists what the file calls out to and what calls into it.
- **Play data flow** → step through one concrete request, narrating each hop.
- **Edge legend** toggles categories.
- Anything that centers the view must convert canvas coordinates to scaled pixels
  (multiply by the active scale) or it centers on the wrong place when zoomed.

## Themes

Support light and dark via `prefers-color-scheme` **and** `:root[data-theme=…]`,
which must win in both directions. Declare every custom property in all scopes.

## The width trade-off

Wider canvas → smaller default fit → smaller text in the lab. A 1200px canvas fits
at ~75% in a 900px pane; 1800px fits at ~50%. So prefer taller over wider: stack a
column rather than widening boxes, and elide signatures before growing the canvas.

## Shipping a change

`architecture.html` is baked into the sandbox image, so a change needs an **image
rebuild**, not `instruqt track push`. See README → Publishing. Verify in a genuinely
fresh sandbox; a pre-warmed one serves the old image.

Before committing, check programmatically: no node overlaps, every node inside its
lane and worker, nothing past the canvas bounds, no code line within a character of
its box width, and the inline script parses.
