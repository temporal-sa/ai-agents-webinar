# Module 1 - Native Temporal AI Agent

A native Temporal AI agent implemented without an agent framework. The workflow calls the OpenAI Responses API directly, dispatches tools as activities, and loops until it has enough information to answer the user's goal.

## Architecture

The agent runs as a Temporal workflow that orchestrates two types of activities:

- **LLM Activity** (`activities/openai_responses.py`) - Calls OpenAI via the `AsyncOpenAI` client's `responses.create()` method. Receives the conversation history, sends it to the model along with tool schemas, and returns the model's response (either a text answer or a tool call).
- **Tool Activities** (`activities/tool_invoker.py`) - A single *dynamic* activity that executes whatever tool the LLM chose, by looking up the handler in a registry. Each tool makes an external HTTP call:

| Tool | API | Purpose |
|------|-----|---------|
| `get_ip_address` | icanhazip.com | Get the caller's public IP address |
| `get_location_info` | ip-api.com | Get city, country, lat/lon for an IP address |
| `get_coordinates` | Open-Meteo Geocoding | Get lat/lon for a city name |
| `get_weather` | Open-Meteo Forecast | Get current temperature, weather code, and wind speed |

Tools are dispatched via Temporal's dynamic activity mechanism — the workflow itself knows nothing about specific tools. It simply forwards the tool name and arguments chosen by the LLM to the generic `dynamic_tool_activity`, which looks up the handler in the registry in `tools/__init__.py`.

The workflow loop:
1. Sends the conversation (system prompt + user goal + any prior tool results) to the LLM activity
2. If the LLM returns a tool call, dispatches it to the dynamic tool activity and adds the result to the conversation
3. If the LLM returns a text response, the agent is done

Temporal provides durable execution — if the worker crashes mid-loop, the workflow replays from history and resumes where it left off without re-executing completed activities.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+**
- **uv** — `brew install uv` (macOS) or see [uv docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- **Temporal CLI** — `brew install temporal` (macOS) or see [Temporal CLI docs](https://docs.temporal.io/cli)
- **OpenAI API key** — set as `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable

## Running

### 1. Start the Temporal dev server

```bash
temporal server start-dev
```

### 2. Set your OpenAI API key

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

### 3. Install dependencies

From either `demo1-agentic-loop/exercise/` or `demo1-agentic-loop/solution/`:

```bash
uv sync
```

### 4. Start the worker

```bash
uv run python -m worker
```

The worker registers the workflow and activities with Temporal and begins polling the `tool-invoking-agent-python-task-queue` task queue. Leave this running.

### 5. Start a workflow

In a second terminal from the same directory:

```bash
uv run python -m start_workflow "What is the weather in Barcelona?"
```

The starter creates a Temporal workflow, waits for the result, prints it, and exits.

### Example prompts

```bash
# Weather by city name (uses get_coordinates -> get_weather)
uv run python -m start_workflow "What is the weather in Tokyo?"

# Weather at current location (uses get_ip_address -> get_location_info -> get_weather)
uv run python -m start_workflow "What is the weather where I am?"

# Multi-city comparison
uv run python -m start_workflow "Compare the weather in London and Sydney right now"
```

## Adding or swapping tools

Tools are fully decoupled from the agent workflow and activity infrastructure. Each tool lives in `tools/` and is exposed through two pieces:

- an **OpenAI tool schema** — JSON describing the function name, description, and parameters (generated from a Pydantic model via the `oai_responses_tool_from_model` helper)
- an **async handler** — the Python function that actually runs

Both are wired up in `tools/__init__.py`.

**To add a new tool**, create a module in `tools/`:

```python
# tools/my_tool.py
from typing import Any
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from helpers import tool_helpers


class MyToolRequest(BaseModel):
    input: str = Field(description="The input")


MY_TOOL_OAI: dict[str, Any] = tool_helpers.oai_responses_tool_from_model(
    "my_tool",
    "Do something useful.",
    MyToolRequest,
)


async def my_tool(req: MyToolRequest) -> str:
    ...  # implementation
```

Then register it in `tools/__init__.py` by adding imports, a branch in `get_handler`, and an entry in `get_tools`:

```python
from .my_tool import MY_TOOL_OAI, my_tool

def get_handler(tool_name: str) -> ToolHandler:
    ...
    if tool_name == "my_tool":
        return my_tool
    ...

def get_tools() -> list[dict[str, Any]]:
    return [..., MY_TOOL_OAI]
```

Nothing else changes — the workflow, dynamic activity, and LLM activity are all tool-agnostic.

> [!NOTE]
> The helper that generates the tool schema uses `openai.lib._pydantic.to_strict_json_schema`, an internal OpenAI API that may change. There is currently no public equivalent for producing strict Responses-API tool schemas from a Pydantic model.

### Observing the workflow

While a workflow is running, you can view it in the Temporal Web UI at [http://localhost:8233](http://localhost:8233). You'll see each LLM call and tool execution as separate activity entries in the workflow history.
