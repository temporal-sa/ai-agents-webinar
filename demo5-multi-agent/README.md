# Module 3 - Multi-agent orchestration

Three OpenAI Agents SDK agents wired together through Temporal: a **personal-assistant** orchestrator delegates to two specialists — a **weather forecaster** and an **F1 expert**. Each specialist runs in its own Temporal workflow execution. The orchestrator invokes one via a **child workflow** and the other via **Nexus**, so the demo shows both cross-workflow primitives side by side.

## Architecture

```

The orchestrator and weather Workers share one Python process; the F1 Worker runs in a second process with its own plugin configuration. Together they poll three distinct task queues, so routing is explicit in the Temporal UI and each specialist can be deployed independently.

## What this module adds

The previous module used one workflow with one agent. This module introduces **agent-as-workflow-as-tool**: each specialist is a real Temporal workflow execution, not an inline function. That gets you durability, retries, and independent visibility per sub-agent.

The orchestrator uses two different patterns to call its specialists:

- **Child workflow** for the weather agent — same namespace, same Temporal cluster, parent-child semantics. Trace context propagates from orchestrator into child via Temporal headers.
- **Nexus** for the F1 expert — designed for cross-namespace / cross-cluster calls. Even within a single namespace it gives you a clean operation-shaped boundary with typed I/O. Trace context does **not** propagate (current limitation in `temporalio.contrib.openai_agents`; see the README's "Known limitations" section).

## Tools

The orchestrator agent sees just two tools:

| Tool | Mechanism | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ask_weather_agent` | child workflow | Delegate weather questions to the weather forecasting specialist |
| `ask_f1_expert` | Nexus operation | Delegate F1 questions to the F1 expert specialist |

Each specialist has its own internal toolkit (weather APIs / F1 MCP). The orchestrator only sees the high-level "ask the specialist" tool.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+**
- **uv** — `brew install uv` on macOS
- **Temporal CLI** — `brew install temporal` on macOS
- **OpenAI API key** — `export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`
- **F1 MCP server** — installed locally and reachable via `F1_MCP_SERVER_HOME`. See the [shared installation instructions](../README.md#f1-mcp-server-modules-2-and-3).

## Running

### 1. Start the Temporal dev server

```bash
temporal server start-dev
```

### 2. Register the Nexus endpoint (one-time)

```bash
temporal operator nexus endpoint create \
    --name f1-expert \
    --target-namespace default \
    --target-task-queue f1-expert-agent-tq
```

The endpoint name (`f1-expert`) must match the `endpoint=` argument used in `personal_assistant.py`. Re-running the command after the endpoint already exists will fail harmlessly — feel free to ignore the error.

### 3. Set your OpenAI API key (both terminals)

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

### 4. Install dependencies

From either `demo5-multi-agent/exercise/` or `demo5-multi-agent/solution/`:

```bash
uv sync
```

### 5. Start the workers (two processes)

The personal-assistant team and the F1 expert team run their own workers with their own plugin configurations. From the selected `exercise/` or `solution/` directory, run these in two terminals:

```bash
# terminal A — PA + weather
uv run python -m worker_pa

# terminal B — F1 expert (separate process, separate plugin config)
uv run python -m worker_f1
```

`worker_pa.py` runs the orchestrator and the weather agent on `orchestrator-tq` and `weather-agent-tq`. `worker_f1.py` runs the F1 expert workflow + Nexus handler on `f1-expert-agent-tq`. The two have different `OpenAIAgentsPlugin` configurations — see "Per-worker plugin configuration" below.

### 6. Start a workflow

In a third terminal from the same directory:

```bash
uv run python -m start_workflow "What's the weather at the next F1 race?"
```

### Example prompts

```bash
# Weather only — orchestrator → weather agent (child workflow)
uv run python -m start_workflow "What is the weather in Monaco?"

# F1 only — orchestrator → F1 expert (Nexus)
uv run python -m start_workflow "When is the next F1 race?"

# Both — orchestrator → F1 expert (Nexus) → weather agent (child workflow)
uv run python -m start_workflow "What's the weather at the next F1 race?"

# Compare F1 venues
uv run python -m start_workflow "Compare the typical weather at Monaco and Singapore Grand Prix dates"
```

### Observing the workflow

In the Temporal Web UI at [http://localhost:8233](http://localhost:8233) you'll see:

- The **orchestrator workflow** on `orchestrator-tq`. Its history shows `StartChildWorkflowExecution` → `ChildWorkflowExecutionCompleted` for the weather path, and `NexusOperationScheduled` → `NexusOperationStarted` → `NexusOperationCompleted` for the F1 path.
- A separate **weather child workflow** on `weather-agent-tq`, with the four weather activities visible in its own history.
- A separate **F1 expert workflow** on `f1-expert-agent-tq`, started by the Nexus operation handler. Its history shows the F1 MCP `f1-data-list-tools` and `f1-data-call-tool-v2` activities.

In the OpenAI trace dashboard at [https://platform.openai.com/traces](https://platform.openai.com/traces):

- The trace `PersonalAssistant` contains the orchestrator's reasoning plus the **weather agent's** spans nested under it (child workflow trace propagation works).
- The **F1 expert** appears as a *separate* trace, not nested under `PersonalAssistant` (see "Known limitations" below).

## Per-worker plugin configuration

`worker_pa.py` and `worker_f1.py` each construct their own `OpenAIAgentsPlugin` with deliberately different settings:

| Worker | `add_temporal_spans` | `mcp_server_providers` | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `worker_pa.py` (PA + weather) | `True` (default) | none | Trace context flows in cleanly via the starter's `with trace(...)` and onward through child workflows. The `temporal:executeWorkflow` / `temporal:startChildWorkflow` / `temporal:startActivity` custom spans render properly in the OpenAI trace dashboard. |
| `worker_f1.py` (F1 expert) | **`False`** | F1 stateless MCP provider | The orchestrator's Nexus call doesn't propagate trace context to this worker (current contrib gap), so the workflow-inbound interceptor would otherwise create `temporal:*` custom spans against no active trace, leaking `parent_id="no-op"` into export batches and producing `[non-fatal] Tracing client error 400` log spam. Disabling `temporal:*` spans on this worker silences the leak. The F1 expert appears as its own top-level trace in the OpenAI dashboard instead of nesting under `PersonalAssistant`. |

This per-worker tuning is a real benefit of running two separate worker processes: each team can choose plugin settings appropriate to its boundary.

## Known limitations

- **Trace context across Nexus is not propagated** by the current `temporalio.contrib.openai_agents` interceptor. The F1 expert therefore produces its own top-level trace in OpenAI's dashboard rather than nesting under the orchestrator trace. Workflow history in Temporal still links the two via the `NexusOperationScheduled` event.

## Production split

In a real deployment you'd typically run the workers as separate processes on separate hosts, possibly owned by separate teams. The two-process layout here matches that pattern — and demonstrates that each owner can configure their plugin independently for their side of the boundary.
